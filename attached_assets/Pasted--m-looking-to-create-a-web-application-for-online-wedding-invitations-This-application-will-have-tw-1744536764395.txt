'm looking to create a web application for online wedding invitations. This application will have two main functionalities: RSVP confirmation and a guestbook for leaving wishes.

I plan to deploy and host this web application on an Amazon EC2 instance. For data storage, I've decided to use Amazon DynamoDB and will need two separate tables: one named 'SVPS' to store RSVP information (fields like guest name, attendance status, number of guests) and another named 'wish' to store the guestbook entries (fields like guest name, their wish/message, and timestamp).

Could you please code the complete web application for me? This should include:

Backend Logic: The necessary server-side code to handle user requests for submitting RSVPs and wishes, and to interact with the DynamoDB tables to store and retrieve data. Please use a lightweight framework like Flask (Python) or Node.js with Express.js (JavaScript) for the backend.
Frontend Interface: A simple and user-friendly HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend with forms for guests to submit their RSVP and leave wishes. The wish submission should ideally trigger an immediate update on the webpage to display the new wish without requiring a full page reload (consider using techniques like AJAX or WebSockets if appropriate for simplicity).
DynamoDB Integration: The code to create the 'SVPS' and 'wish' tables in DynamoDB (if possible within the scope of the code generation, otherwise provide instructions) and the logic to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete - though Delete might not be necessary for this application) operations on these tables.
In addition to the code, please provide a detailed, step-by-step explanation of how to deploy this web application to an Amazon EC2 instance. This deployment guide should cover:

Setting up an EC2 instance: Instructions on launching an appropriate EC2 instance type, configuring security groups (allowing necessary ports like HTTP/HTTPS), and connecting to the instance via SSH.
Installing necessary software: Steps to install the required runtime environment (Python/Node.js), any necessary packages or dependencies (like the AWS SDK), and the web application code onto the EC2 instance.
Configuring AWS credentials: Explanation of how to securely configure AWS credentials on the EC2 instance so that the application can interact with DynamoDB.
Running the web application: Instructions on how to start the web application on the EC2 instance (e.g., using a process manager like screen or systemd).
Accessing the web application: How to access the deployed application via the public IP or DNS of the EC2 instance.
Basic monitoring and considerations: Any basic monitoring suggestions or important considerations for running a web application on EC2.
Thank you for your comprehensive assistance with this project.
